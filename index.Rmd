- Monitoring waste tipping operations (checking for combustible loads), providing fire-fighting equipment (to quickly extinguish
any fires encountered) and **constantly observing the landfill for any signs of sub-surface fires** are all good management practices to prevent and control landfill fires and thereby minimise their associated negative impacts.

- Identification of credible LFG WtE projects will therefore **require a significant amount of research and effort to find the landfills with the highest WtE potential**. It should be assumed, therefore, that **full and extensive baseline surveys** will be required.

How is CHG measured under ADIPURA data base? (open dumping > predominently no collection and ventilation system)

landfill without gas recovery infrastructure
- Drilling into the landfill as deep as the thickness of the refuse layer.
- inflow of gas = Perforated pipe with certain diameter is inserted.
- The perforated pipe circulated with gravel is performed in order to protect the blocking by refuse particles
- The gas analyzer used for CH4 , CO2  and O2 measurement (portable)

**Issue with the above approach**
- No gas recovery infrastructure prepared (open dumpsite)
- Gas generation fluctuates from one place to another
- measurement window: 5-10 years

# Project Output

## Landfill Monitoring Dashboard

The output of this project includes a map of methane emissions from the Bantargebang landfill and an estimation of the total emissions from the site. This information can be used by stakeholders to better understand the extent of the methane emission problem at the landfill and to develop strategies for reducing those emissions.

## Landfill Monitoring Dashboard

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Usefulness]

1. **Improved public health and environmental outcomes**<br>Reducing methane emissions from landfills can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize the risk of fires and explosions.

2. **Increased efficiency of methane mitigation strategies**<br>With periodical data on methane emissions, landfill operators can optimize their methane mitigation strategies, which can help to reduce overall emissions.

3. **Reduced costs**<br>By optimizing methane mitigation strategies, landfill operators can reduce the cost of mitigating methane emissions.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Utilisation]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Limitations]

1. **Limited availability of satellite imagery**<br>The project heavily relies on the availability of satellite imagery to monitor methane emissions from the landfill. However, cloud cover and other atmospheric conditions can impact the quality and availability of satellite imagery, which can limit the accuracy of the methane emission estimates.

2. **Limited temporal resolution**<br>The project relies on satellite imagery with limited temporal resolution. Frequent updates are needed to accurately monitor methane emissions from landfills, and more frequent satellite imagery could provide more accurate and up-to-date estimates.

3. **Limited spatial resolution**<br>The spatial resolution of satellite imagery can also limit the accuracy of methane emission estimates, especially in cases where methane emissions are highly localized. Other resources such as aerial imagery which has very high spatial resolution can be added in the future works.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Future Works]

1. **Expanding the analysis to other landfills**<br>This project focused on the Bantargebang landfill in Jakarta, Indonesia. Similar analyses could be conducted for other landfills around Indonesia to better understand the national methane emissions problem from landfills and contribute to national strategic plan to reduce greenhouse gas emission.

2. **Incorporating other data sources**<br>This project used satellite data to estimate methane emissions. Additional data sources, such as ground-based sensors and drone-based imagery, could be incorporated into the analysis to improve the accuracy of methane emission estimates.

3. **Developing predictive models**<br>By analyzing historical data on methane emissions and other relevant factors, predictive models could be developed that could help landfill operators to proactively manage methane emissions and optimize their mitigation strategies.

# Risk Management

## Risk Management

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[**Data acquisition**]

There may be challenges in acquiring reliable satellite data due to poor weather conditions or satellite malfunction. 

Mitigation strategy: Have backup plans in place such as purchasing data from multiple sources and scheduling satellite passes at different times to increase the chance of obtaining good quality data.


]

.panel[.panel-name[**Technical**]

The processing of satellite imagery and the estimation of methane emissions requires advanced technical expertise. 

Mitigation strategy: Ensure that the team members responsible for data processing and analysis are highly skilled and trained in the latest techniques and technologies. This is can be ensured in the recruiting process.

]

.panel[.panel-name[**Human resources**]

There may be difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel for the project. The other possibility is human resources terminate the contract before the project ended. The project team might face the risk of losing the resources before the project is completed. This can cause a delay in the project timeline and could lead to additional costs to recruit new resources.

Mitigation strategy: Create a competitive compensation package and offer professional development opportunities to retain top talent.The project manager should ensure that the project team members are committed to the project and have signed a contract to complete the project. The project manager should also maintain open communication with the team members and address any issues or concerns that arise during the project. If a team member needs to be replaced, a contingency plan should be in place to minimize the impact on the project timeline. Additionally, the project manager should identify and document the knowledge and skills of each team member to ensure a smooth transition if a team member needs to be replaced.

]

.panel[.panel-name[**Operational**]

There may be issues with the operation of the methane monitoring dashboard such as data transmission failure, software malfunctions or hacking. 

Mitigation strategy: Perform regular maintenance and software updates on the dashboard and implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

]

.panel[.panel-name[**Financial**]

The project budget may exceed the allocated funds due to unforeseen expenses or cost overruns. 

Mitigation strategy: Set aside contingency funds to cover unexpected expenses and regularly monitor project expenses to stay within budget.

]

.panel[.panel-name[**Stakeholders**]

There may be disagreements or conflicts with stakeholders on project objectives or implementation strategies. 

Mitigation strategy: Hold regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure transparency and open communication, and be open to feedback and suggestions.
